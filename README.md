##  WELCOME TO MY FAB LAB WORLD 
HI.... ThafseerA here!!!!
    
## ABOUT ME
I'm THAFSEERA born and raised in MALAPPURAM. I did my plus 2 from P K M M H S S Edarikode and now i'm pursuing my final year B.tech in electronics and communication at M E S college of engineering Kuttipuram.I have a beautiful family of six members.
My hobbies including to help my mother in her some time work and listining music.

My strengths are my attitude that i like to take challenges that I CAN do it,my way of thinking that i take both success and failure in a balanced manner..
I dont like to say weakness but i like to say scope for improvement that is i wont leave any ask in completely,i believe in my self and my hard work and i want perfection in every thing.

## WHAT IS FAB LAB

   FabLab – digital fabrication laboratories – were set up to inspire people and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new products and prototypes by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology.
    The idea was conceived by renowned inventor and scientist Professor Neil Gershenfeld at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His idea was a simple one: to provide the environment, skills, advanced materials and technology to make things cheaply and quickly anywhere in the world, and to make this available on a local basis to entrepreneurs, students, artists, small businesses and in fact, anyone who wants to create something new or bespoke.
## FAB LAB AT MESCE 

![GitHub Logo](/images/B612_20170826_134534.jpg)
FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality. It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could turn one’s imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE. I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well … explore and have fun.

## Rhinoceros
   Rhinoceros (typically abbreviated Rhino, or Rhino3D) is a commercial 3D computer graphics and computer-aided design (CAD) application software developed by Robert McNeel & Associates; an American, privately held, employee-owned company, that was founded in 1980. Rhinoceros geometry is based on the NURBS mathematical model, which focuses on producing mathematically precise representation of curves and freeform surfaces in computer graphics (as opposed to polygon mesh-based applications).

Rhinoceros is used in processes of computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM), rapid prototyping, 3D printing and reverse engineering in industries including architecture, industrial design (e.g. automotive design, watercraft design), product design (e.g. jewelry design) as well as for multimedia and graphic design.[2]

Rhinoceros is developed for the Microsoft Windows operating system and OS X. A visual scripting language add-on for Rhino, Grasshopper, is developed by Robert McNeel & Associates.
## EAGLE
Eagle Software ascertains itself as a paramount institution in provid ing software products and solutions for Health Care, Micro-Finance, Insurance and Immigration. We develop mobile phone games, online lott ery applications and deliver value added services for mobile phone ga mes. We deliver end-to-end solutions for web and desktop applications based on Smart Card / RFID Solutionstechnology.


## AUTOCAD
 AutoCAD is a commercial computer-aided design (CAD) and drafting software application. Developed and marketed by Autodesk,[1] AutoCAD was first rel eased in December 1982 as a desktop app running on microcomputers with in ternal graphics controllers.[2] Prior to the introduction of AutoCAD, most commercial CAD programs ran on mainframe computers or minicomputers, with each CAD operator (user) working at a separate graphics terminal.[3] Since 2010, AutoCAD was released as a mobile- and web app as well, marketed as AutoCAD 360.


## SOLIDWORKS
 SOLIDWORKS solutions cover all aspects of your product development process with a seamless, integrated workflow—design, verification, sustainable des ign, communication and data management. The intuitive design interface and integrated software work together and give you the freedom to focus on inn ovation, thus giving you the possibility to span multiple disciplines with ease.


## CUTSTUDIO
 Easy Cut Studio is the industry’s premiere sign making and vinyl cutting sof tware for Windows that allows you to cut any TrueType font, any SVG image a nd any design you want using an electronic cutting machine ( vinyl cutter a nd cutting plotter). Works with your installed TrueType and OpenType, and Di ngbat/Wingding fonts. This viny cutting software can import various file fo rmats but also provides a full set of drawing and editing tools to create yo ur own designs for cutting.
 
# DAY 1 [23-08-2017] 
 went well with the introduction by   Mr. Jaseel Muhammed an overview of how the 21 hrs were going to be spent at FABLAB. We went through and just got introduced to all the machines we were going to use and play with. So, today we entered the magical world and were all set to explore more. we created an account in github.also we get an idea about Rhino.we draw some 3d models.
## INTRODUCTION OF MACHINES
* 3D PRINTER

* VINYLE CUTTER

* LASER CUTTING MACHINE 

* ELECTRONICS PRODUCTION AND CNC

# DAY 2[24-08-2017]  
I did A SMALL work in vinyle cutting machine.

## what is vinyl cutting machine?

![VINYLE CUTTER](/images/B612_20170826_134255.jpg)

 A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).
A symbol / label can be produced using a Vinyl Cutter such as a ‘Sticker Machine’ or a ‘Craftrobo’. These machines are controlled by a computer and operate similar to a printer. Essentially they cut out shapes in adhesive vinyl. The vinyl can then be stuck onto almost any surface.
A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen. A vector based design is created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well. The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colors of vinyl. A design with multiple colors must have each color cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colors, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a standalone cutter.
# DAY 3 [25-08-2017].
 PCB design. introduction about eagle .we did small LED blinging circuit.

# DAY 4[26-08-2017]
3D printing. by using rhino and cura i did a small work in 3D printing

## about 3d printing
3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.

The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.

3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.

3D printing enables you to produce complex (functional) shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.
