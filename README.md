# WHAT IS FAB LAB

![FAB LAB LOGO](/images/LOGO.png)  FabLab – digital fabrication laboratories – were set up to inspire people and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new products and prototypes by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology.
    The idea was conceived by renowned inventor and scientist Professor Neil Gershenfeld at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His idea was a simple one: to provide the environment, skills, advanced materials and technology to make things cheaply and quickly anywhere in the world, and to make this available on a local basis to entrepreneurs, students, artists, small businesses and in fact, anyone who wants to create something new or bespoke.
    
## FAB LAB AT MESCE 

### MESCE FAB LAB

![FAB LAB LOGO](/images/lab.jpg)


FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality. It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could turn one’s imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE.I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well … explore and have fun.

# DAY 1 [23-08-2017] 

 went well with the introduction by   Mr. Jaseel Muhammed an overview of how the 21 hrs were going to be spent at FABLAB. We went through and just got introduced to all the machines we were going to use and play with. So, today we entered the magical world and were all set to explore more. we created an account in github.also we get an idea about Rhino.we draw some 3d models.
 
## INTRODUCTION OF MACHINES

## * 3D PRINTER

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.

![FAB LAB LOGO](/images/3D.jpg)

## * VINYLE CUTTER

![FAB LAB LOGO](/images/vyo.jpg)

A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).

## * LASER CUTTING MACHINE 

Laser cuttinghttp://www.thomasnet.com/images/suppliers-small.png uses a high-powered beam to cut material based on computer-controlled parameters. As the laser guides its beam along the material, everything in its direct path is vaporized, burned or melted. One of the benefits of laser cutting technology is the cut product rarely needs any finishing work as this process ensures a high-quality surface finish.

![FAB LAB LOGO](/images/lo.jpg)


## * ELECTRONICS PRODUCTION AND CNC

![FAB LAB LOGO](/images/pc.jpg)

CNC Machining is a process used in the manufacturing sector that involves the use of computers to control machine tools. Tools that can be controlled in this manner include lathes, mills, routers and grinders. The CNC in CNC Machining stands for Computer Numerical Control.

## Github pages And Documentation

### What Is GitHub, and What Is It Used For?

![STICKER](/images/git1.png)

GitHub is a website and service that we hear geeks rave about all the time, yet a lot of people don’t really understand what it does. Want to know what all the GitHub hubbub is about? Read on to find out.
### The “Git” in GitHub
o understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Trovalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.

Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.

Similarly, people who have nothing to do with the development of a project can still download the files and use them. Most Linux users should be familiar with this process, as using Git, Subversion, or some other similar method is pretty common for downloading needed files—especially in preparation for compiling a program from source code (a rather common practice for Linux geeks).

Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, since it has multiple advantages over the other systems available. It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better. If you’re interested in knowing the details, the Git Basics page has a thorough explanation on how Git works.

### The “Hub” in GitHub

We’ve established that Git is a version control system, similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

Let’s go over a few of the main reasons that geeks like to use GitHub, and learn some terminology along the way.

### Repository

A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL.

![STICKER](/images/git2.jpg)

### Forking a Repo

“Forking” is when you create a new project based off of another project that already exists. This is an amazing feature that vastly encourages the further development of programs and other projects. If you find a project on GitHub that you’d like to contribute to, you can fork the repo, make the changes you’d like, and release the revised project as a new repo. If the original repository that you forked to create your new project gets updated, you can easily add those updates to your current fork.

### Pull Requests

You’ve forked a repository, made a great revision to the project, and want it to be recognized by the original developers—maybe even included in the official project/repository. You can do so by creating a pull request. The authors of the original repository can see your work, and then choose whether or not to accept it into the official project. Whenever you issue a pull request, GitHub provides a perfect medium for you and the main project’s maintainer to communicate.

### Social networking

The social networking aspect of GitHub is probably its most powerful feature, allowing projects to grow more than just about any of the other features offered. Each user on GitHub has their own profile that acts like a resume of sorts, showing your past work and contributions to other projects via pull requests.

Project revisions can be discussed publicly, so a mass of experts can contribute knowledge and collaborate to advance a project forward. Before the advent of GitHub, developers interested in contributing to a project would usually need to find some means of contacting the authors—probably by email—and then convince them that they can be trusted and their contribution is legit.

### Changelogs

When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.

### GitHub Isn’t Just for Developers

All this talk about how GitHub is ideal for programmers may have you believing that they are the only ones who will find it useful. Although it’s a lot less common, you can actually use GitHub for any types of files. If you have a team that is constantly making changes to a word document, for example,  you could use GitHub as your version control system. This practice isn’t common, since there are better alternatives in most cases, but it’s something to keep in mind.

## STEPS

### Step 1: Github Account and Project Repository

First of all, before you are able to create a Github page, you need a Github account, and then you also need to create your project repository. You can easily create a new project repo by using Github application, which is available for both Windows and OS X.

### Step 2: Create Local Repository

![STICKER](/images/S2.jpg)

Assuming that you have an existing project ready to publish, you can open the Github application – in this example, I’m using the one for OSX – and add it as your Local Repository. To do so, click on the “+” button that is found at the bottom of the application. Then select the folder where you saved the project.

### Step 3: Push to Github

![STICKER](/images/S3.jpg)

After creating the Local Repository, you need to push it to Github. At this point, unless you have a Pro account where you are able to set your project to Private, it will be available for the public at Github, meaning that anyone can download and fork your project.



### Step 4: Create Github Page

![STICKER](/images/S4.jpg)

Creating a page for your project, go to your project repository – usually github.com/username/project-name.

And go to the Settings page. This is where you setup your project repo, and create the page for it.



### Step 5: Change Title and Content

![STICKER](/images/S5.jpg)

Now, it’s time to change the title, the content of your project page (in Markdown), and if you want to, you can also insert your Google Analytics ID to allow tracking of visitors to your page. If you are done editing the content, you can Continue to Layouts.



### Step 6: Select Page Theme

![STICKER](/images/S6.jpg)

Github has provided several themes to choose from for your page. If the themes do not meet your taste, you can create and design your own with an index.html and stylesheet (perhaps in another tutorial).



### Step 7: Publish the Page

![STICKER](/images/S7.jpg)

Lastly, click on the Publish button, and allow Github around 10 minutes to process your page.




# DAY 3[26-08-2017]
3D printing. by using rhino and cura i did a small work in 3D printing.

## about 3d printing

3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.

The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.


3D printing enables you to produce complex (functional) shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.


## RHINOCEROS

![](/images/R1.jpg)

Rhinoceros 3D relies on a few plug-ins that facilitate 3D printing [6][7][8] and allows the export of the .STL and .OBJ file formats, both of which are supported by numerous 3D printers and 3D printing services.

In a recent overview leading 3D printing service provider i.materialise compared the top 25 most popular 3D modelling software programs in use today.

Despite Rhinoceros 3D's plug-ins for supporting 3D printing, Rhinoceros 3D only scored a 13th place in this extensive survey coming in behind industry standard 3D packages like SolidWorks.

![](/images/R2.png)

## CURA

Cura is a 3D printer slicing application.[1] It was created by David Braam; he was later employed by Ultimaker to maintain the software. Cura has been released under the open source Affero General Public License version 3.[2] Development is hosted on GitHub.[2] Cura is the preferred slicer software for Ultimaker 3d printers, but can be used with other printers as well.

## ABOUT LASER CUTTING MACHINE

![LASER CUTTING MACHINE](/images/L3.jpg)

### What is LASER cutting?

Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics.

### How do you use laser cutting machine?

Steps

1-Obtain a laser cutter. ...

2-Create an image that you wish to cut. ...

3-Choose the material you are going to cut your image onto. ...

4-Check to make sure the lens is clean. ...

5-Turn on your machine and get ready to cut. ...

6-Set your laser cutter's line width and cutting speed and then cut out your image.

### how does a laser cutting machine works?

When cutting stainless steel or aluminum, the laser beam simply melts the material, and high pressure nitrogen is used to blow the molten metal out of the kerf. On a CNC laser cutter, the laser cutting head is moved over the metal plate in the shape of the desired part, thus cutting the part out of the plate.

### what can laser cutter cut through?

#### Materials we can laser cut

* Plastics: ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) Acrylic (also known as Plexiglas, Lucite, PMMA) ...
* Thin metals: Stainless steel (up to 0.060") Spring steel (up to 0.060")
* Foam: Depron foam – often used for RC planes. EPM. ...
* Other: Cloths (leather, suede, felt, hemp, cotton) Magnetic sheets.

     using Rhino or any other drawing software you can draw your laser cutting model

To convert your schematic to a board all you have to do is press the board button. Ones you clicked that a window should pop up and you should see your components outside of the square.to move your components click the move button. The yellow lines that you see connecting your components means that they are unrouted. There are 2 ways to rout your component.one way is by hand and the other way is using the auto route button. To rout by hand you click the rout button then click the two ends of the components. When the line that you make is red then its on the top of the board if the line is blue than it is on the bottom.to use auto route just click auto.
#### Step 4: Other Things

![JET WORK BY LASER](/images/E4.jpg)

You can also add text in your board all you have to do is click the button that seas text, type what you want it to say then click ok. Your text might come up in red or blue this Is not good but it is ease to fix. All you have to do Is click select layer button then find ether Tsilk or Bsilk. Tsilk means that your text will be on the silk layer on the top of the board. Bsilk means that your text will be on the bottom of the board. Then click where you want your text to be just make sure that it is not over any holes, or pads.

#### Step 5: Finished

## ShopBot Machine Setup
1. Secure your work piece

Use at least 3 clamps to secure the work piece.

* Make sure your clamps will not be in the way of the bit.
* Make sure your clamps are not hanging over the edge of the workspace as they will get in the way of the machine.


![JET WORK BY LASER](/images/k1.jpg)

### 2. Insert the bit

Use the wrenches to remove the bit from the collet.

Place a scrap piece of foam, wood or plastic below the bit in case it falls out of the collet when removing.


![JET WORK BY LASER](/images/k2.png)

#### Remove collet (if necessary) and insert new collet.


![JET WORK BY LASER](/images/k22.png)

#### Select a bit

![JET WORK BY LASER](/images/k222.png)

End Mill: good for straight cuts and for hogging out a lot of material (ie. for a roughing toolpath)
Ball-Nose: good for contours, details, and finishing paths
Profile (such as a V-Carve): good for lettering and sign-making

The larger the bit the better (quicker mill and less likely to break).

### 3. Zero X, Y, and Z axes

Zero X and Y:
Select the button that looks like a miniature version of the yellow keypad. Use the keypads arrow buttons to set move to the bottom (closest to you) left corner of your material.


![JET WORK BY LASER](/images/k3.png)

Select the blue ‘Zero Axis’ button and select the X and Y checkboxes.

![JET WORK BY LASER](/images/k33.png)

Zero Z:
Set up the place and clamp system.

# DAY 7
## VINYLE CUTTING


## what is vinyl cutting machine?

![VINYLE CUTTER](/images/B612_20170826_134255.jpg)

 A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).
A symbol / label can be produced using a Vinyl Cutter such as a ‘Sticker Machine’ or a ‘Craftrobo’. These machines are controlled by a computer and operate similar to a printer. Essentially they cut out shapes in adhesive vinyl. The vinyl can then be stuck onto almost any surface.
A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen. A vector based design is created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well. The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colors of vinyl. A design with multiple colors must have each color cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colors, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a standalone cutter.
## STEPS
### 1-Create your artwork.
* Simple artwork like text is the easiest artwork to cut with a vinyl cutter. All keyboard fonts are considered vinyl cutter ready vector art (VCRVA or VCVA). All text on all the Windows or Mac included fonts can be typed directly into a vinyl cutting program. This includes fonts like Symbol. Alternatively, you can draw shapes and prepare vector art specifically for vinyl cutting with a graphics program like InkScape, Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator. Usually, when people want to vinyl cut an image, creating clean vector art is the most time consuming process but yet it is the most important.
* Creating clean VCRVA is even more time consuming because adequate thought has to go into figuring out what portions of your design you are going to keep and what portions you are going to remove or 'weed' away.
* If you take a photograph and bring it into a cutting program like Flexi Starter 10 and automatically convert it into vector art you will likely have a mess to clean up. Vector art format differs from bitmap or JPEG art format in that vector art contains lines and arcs to define the picture whereas bitmaps and their equivalents are just a pattern of pixels without any edge definition. Your vinyl cutter can cut lines, arcs and circles but cannot cut a pixel so all artwork must be converted to vector art so your vinyl cutter can cut it properly. It turns out that Flexi interpreted the yellow as 8 shades of yellow and created edges between the different shades of yellow and separated these edges onto different layers. In the end, a simple black, yellow and blue image ended up being 25 different colors and had edges on 25 different layers. Most of the issues associated with vinyl cutting are related to vector art quality.
![STICKER](/images/J2.webp)
# 2 
Aside from simple fonts already in the Windows or Mac operating system, you can purchase additional fonts, or you can purchase artwork that is Vinyl Cutter Ready Vector Art such as the Mega Vector Art Collection. Also, if your artwork is complex, consider sending it out to an outside vendor to have it vectorized for you. There is also software available such as Vector Magic that can do auto-vectorizing and cleanup for you.
![STICKER](/images/J3.webp)
# 3
Bring your artwork into a vinyl cutter cutting program. Once you have created artwork in a program such as Illustrator, Corel Draw or InkScape, you will need to import it into a vinyl cutter program. There are several vinyl cutter programs available on the market. The most common is Flexi Starter 10 (and numerous private label versions of it) followed by programs like SignCut. These programs will lay out your artwork on your vinyl, create weeding lines, create a weeding frame or box, allow you to make copies in rows and columns, scale and rotate, layer the cuts and do several other functions and finally, send the cutting commands to the vinyl cutter.
![STICKER](/images/J4.webp)
# 4
Connect up your vinyl cutter. Different vinyl cutters will have various methods to connect up to your computer. Many if not most these days connect up through the USB port. Once you have established the connection between your cutter and your computer (some drivers may need to be installed) you will need to choose the port or the specific cutter in the sign cutting software to establish the connection between your vinyl cutter and the software.
* The vinyl cutting industry is more geared to PC's and not Macs. There are systems that are Mac compatible like SignCut but Flexi is not very Mac compatible in its current version. Make sure that your cutter is in the online mode and that the cutter and correct port are selected in the cutting software. This is very important to establish proper communication.

![STICKER](/images/J5.webp)

# 5
Load your material. Basically, vinyl material is roll fed into a vinyl cutter and hangs off the back side of the cutter on rollers or on a roller bar. Feed the vinyl under the pinch rollers and on top of the roller bar and then release the rollers to hold the vinyl in place.
![STICKER](/images/J6.webp)
# 6
Select and set up setup your blade. Blades usually come in angles from 20° to 60° or so. The larger the blade angle, the sharper the blade, but the quicker the blade will dull. 45° blades strike a good balance between wear and sharpness. 60° blades are sharper and are widely used.
* Setting up blade depth and pressure or force is critical to getting good cuts. There are basically two parameters that need to be set to achieve good cutting. One is blade depth relative to the carriage and the other is pressure set by the cutter. These parameters vary in importance between machine manufacturers.
* A good way to set blade tip height is to peel off the vinyl and expose the vinyl backing. Place the blade holder in the down position.
Some machines have a button control that will allow you to automatically push the carriage to the blade down position while for other carriages you will need to push down on the blade holder manually. Fasten the blade position so that the tip of the blade is slightly penetrating the top surface of the vinyl backing. From here, you will need to set the pressure.

Create a small line of text that you can send to the cutter. Set the pressure at a low level and send a cut to the cutter. Chances are that you will not cut fully through the vinyl. Increase the pressure by an increment of your choosing, move the carriage over and cut this same text again. Continue to do this and remember the pressure setting for each cut until you are penetrating the vinyl backing but not going through it.

Weed all the text you have cut. The one that weeds the best and leaves a slight impression on the vinyl backing is the optimized setting for this vinyl. This process of setting blade tip depth and pressure may need to be repeated each time you change vinyl type as the release liner thicknesses and vinyl characteristics will change from roll to roll and may require different tip depths or cutting pressUres. Usually, once a cutter is setup for vinyl, you can cut that roll and additional rolls as long as it is all the same type of Vinyl.

Cut your artwork. Use the cutting feature of your sign cutting software to send your artwork to the vinyl cutter. Cutting your artwork can take as little as a few seconds to several hours depending on complexity. Most simple signs and decals take just a few minutes.

Remove your cut vinyl. Advance the vinyl roll with the cutter control panel or release the rollers and pull your vinyl forward. Use rolling scissors to trim your vinyl from the base roll.

Weed your vinyl. Assuming you did a good job setting up your cutter your artwork should weed relatively easily. Weeding is the process of removing material that you don't want in your graphics. The smaller the features in your graphic, the more challenging weeding can become. Use a weeding pick to carefully pull up and remove the portions of vinyl that you don't want to transfer to your target surface. Strategically placed weeding lines are recommended to make this process easier. It is sometimes very difficult to weed all your unwanted material if it is all connected in one piece. This is also sometimes a time consuming and delicate process.

Apply transfer tape. With your image weeded, the next step to take will be to transfer your image from the release liner to the target surface. TIP: If you are applying your image to the inside of glass make sure to cut the mirror image so it appears correct when viewed from the outside of the glass. Transfer tape is similar to masking tape but has a different tack for adhering to your vinyl but releasing it on the target surface. Use a semi-transparent transfer tape to apply your graphics. Transfer tape comes in many widths up to about 48". If you have an image that is 6" tall but only have transfer tape that is 4" wide you can lay multiple strips down to cover your image completely and overlap the transfer tape by ¼" or so. You will want to use your squeegee with a felt sleeve to rub the transfer tape on the vinyl to insure good adhesion.

Prepare your target surface. Your target surface should be prepared by cleaning with rubbing alcohol or other similar cleaner to remove grease, oil and dirt. In addition, the surface can be prepared with an application liquid spray that will allow the vinyl to not immediately stick to the target surface. This will allow you to reposition the graphic on the target surface before allowing it to dry and permanently adhere and remove air bubbles. This saves lots of time and avoids having to redo the job.

Apply your graphics. Peel the transfer tape away from the release liner and your graphics should come with your transfer tape. If they don't, push the transfer tape back down and use your squeegee again to stick the transfer tape to the decal. Take this decal and apply it to the target surface. From there, use your squeegee with a felt sleeve to smooth your decal on your target surface removing all air bubbles. Allow to dry if you applied application liquid and then peel off your transfer tape.
