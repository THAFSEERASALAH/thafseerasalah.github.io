# WHAT IS FAB LAB

![FAB LAB LOGO](/images/LOGO.png)

   FabLab – digital fabrication laboratories – were set up to inspire people and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new products and prototypes by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology.
    The idea was conceived by renowned inventor and scientist Professor Neil Gershenfeld at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His idea was a simple one: to provide the environment, skills, advanced materials and technology to make things cheaply and quickly anywhere in the world, and to make this available on a local basis to entrepreneurs, students, artists, small businesses and in fact, anyone who wants to create something new or bespoke.

FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality. It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could turn one’s imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE. I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well … explore and have fun.


# DAY 1 [23-08-2017] 
 went well with the introduction by   Mr. Jaseel Muhammed an overview of how the 21 hrs were going to be spent at FABLAB. We went through and just got introduced to all the machines we were going to use and play with. So, today we entered the magical world and were all set to explore more. we created an account in github.also we get an idea about Rhino.we draw some 3d models.

## Github pages And Documentation
### What Is GitHub, and What Is It Used For?

![STICKER](/images/git1.png)

GitHub is a website and service that we hear geeks rave about all the time, yet a lot of people don’t really understand what it does. Want to know what all the GitHub hubbub is about? Read on to find out.
### The “Git” in GitHub
o understand GitHub, you must first have an understanding of Git. Git is an open-source version control system that was started by Linus Trovalds—the same person who created Linux. Git is similar to other version control systems—Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.

Version control systems keep these revisions straight, storing the modifications in a central repository. This allows developers to easily collaborate, as they can download a new version of the software, make changes, and upload the newest revision. Every developer can see these new changes, download them, and contribute.

Similarly, people who have nothing to do with the development of a project can still download the files and use them. Most Linux users should be familiar with this process, as using Git, Subversion, or some other similar method is pretty common for downloading needed files—especially in preparation for compiling a program from source code (a rather common practice for Linux geeks).

Git is the preferred version control system of most developers, since it has multiple advantages over the other systems available. It stores file changes more efficiently and ensures file integrity better. If you’re interested in knowing the details, the Git Basics page has a thorough explanation on how Git works.

### The “Hub” in GitHub

We’ve established that Git is a version control system, similar but better than the many alternatives available. So, what makes GitHub so special? Git is a command-line tool, but the center around which all things involving Git revolve is the hub—GitHub.com—where developers store their projects and network with like minded people.

Let’s go over a few of the main reasons that geeks like to use GitHub, and learn some terminology along the way.

Repository

A repository (usually abbreviated to “repo”) is a location where all the files for a particular project are stored. Each project has its own repo, and you can access it with a unique URL.

![STICKER](/images/git2.jpg)

### Forking a Repo

“Forking” is when you create a new project based off of another project that already exists. This is an amazing feature that vastly encourages the further development of programs and other projects. If you find a project on GitHub that you’d like to contribute to, you can fork the repo, make the changes you’d like, and release the revised project as a new repo. If the original repository that you forked to create your new project gets updated, you can easily add those updates to your current fork.

### Pull Requests

You’ve forked a repository, made a great revision to the project, and want it to be recognized by the original developers—maybe even included in the official project/repository. You can do so by creating a pull request. The authors of the original repository can see your work, and then choose whether or not to accept it into the official project. Whenever you issue a pull request, GitHub provides a perfect medium for you and the main project’s maintainer to communicate.

### Social networking

The social networking aspect of GitHub is probably its most powerful feature, allowing projects to grow more than just about any of the other features offered. Each user on GitHub has their own profile that acts like a resume of sorts, showing your past work and contributions to other projects via pull requests.

Project revisions can be discussed publicly, so a mass of experts can contribute knowledge and collaborate to advance a project forward. Before the advent of GitHub, developers interested in contributing to a project would usually need to find some means of contacting the authors—probably by email—and then convince them that they can be trusted and their contribution is legit.

### Changelogs

When multiple people collaborate on a project, it’s hard to keep track revisions—who changed what, when, and where those files are stored. GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.

### GitHub Isn’t Just for Developers

All this talk about how GitHub is ideal for programmers may have you believing that they are the only ones who will find it useful. Although it’s a lot less common, you can actually use GitHub for any types of files. If you have a team that is constantly making changes to a word document, for example,  you could use GitHub as your version control system. This practice isn’t common, since there are better alternatives in most cases, but it’s something to keep in mind.

## STEPS 
### Step 1: Github Account and Project Repository

First of all, before you are able to create a Github page, you need a Github account, and then you also need to create your project repository. You can easily create a new project repo by using Github application, which is available for both Windows and OS X.

### Step 2: Create Local Repository

![STICKER](/images/S2.jpg)

Assuming that you have an existing project ready to publish, you can open the Github application – in this example, I’m using the one for OSX – and add it as your Local Repository. To do so, click on the “+” button that is found at the bottom of the application. Then select the folder where you saved the project.

### Step 3: Push to Github

![STICKER](/images/S3.jpg)

After creating the Local Repository, you need to push it to Github. At this point, unless you have a Pro account where you are able to set your project to Private, it will be available for the public at Github, meaning that anyone can download and fork your project.



### Step 4: Create Github Page

![STICKER](/images/S4.jpg)

Creating a page for your project, go to your project repository – usually github.com/username/project-name.

And go to the Settings page. This is where you setup your project repo, and create the page for it.



### Step 5: Change Title and Content

![STICKER](/images/S5.jpg)

Now, it’s time to change the title, the content of your project page (in Markdown), and if you want to, you can also insert your Google Analytics ID to allow tracking of visitors to your page. If you are done editing the content, you can Continue to Layouts.



### Step 6: Select Page Theme

![STICKER](/images/S6.jpg)

Github has provided several themes to choose from for your page. If the themes do not meet your taste, you can create and design your own with an index.html and stylesheet (perhaps in another tutorial).



### Step 7: Publish the Page

![STICKER](/images/S7.jpg)

Lastly, click on the Publish button, and allow Github around 10 minutes to process your page.


# DAY 3
I did A SMALL work in vinyle cutting machine.



![STICKER](/images/v1.jpg)


## what is vinyl cutting machine?

![VINYLE CUTTER](/images/B612_20170826_134255.jpg)

 A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).
A symbol / label can be produced using a Vinyl Cutter such as a ‘Sticker Machine’ or a ‘Craftrobo’. These machines are controlled by a computer and operate similar to a printer. Essentially they cut out shapes in adhesive vinyl. The vinyl can then be stuck onto almost any surface.
A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen. A vector based design is created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well. The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colors of vinyl. A design with multiple colors must have each color cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colors, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a standalone cutter.

## about 3d printing

3D printing or additive manufacturing is a process of making three dimensional solid objects from a digital file.

The creation of a 3D printed object is achieved using additive processes. In an additive process an object is created by laying down successive layers of material until the object is created. Each of these layers can be seen as a thinly sliced horizontal cross-section of the eventual object.

3D printing is the opposite of subtractive manufacturing which is cutting out / hollowing out a piece of metal or plastic with for instance a milling machine.

3D printing enables you to produce complex (functional) shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods.

## ABOUT LASER CUTTING MACHINE

![LASER CUTTING MACHINE](/images/L3.jpg)

### What is LASER cutting?

Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics.

### How do you use laser cutting machine?

Steps
1-Obtain a laser cutter. ...

2-Create an image that you wish to cut. ...

3-Choose the material you are going to cut your image onto. ...

4-Check to make sure the lens is clean. ...

5-Turn on your machine and get ready to cut. ...

6-Set your laser cutter's line width and cutting speed and then cut out your image.

### how does a laser cutting machine works?

When cutting stainless steel or aluminum, the laser beam simply melts the material, and high pressure nitrogen is used to blow the molten metal out of the kerf. On a CNC laser cutter, the laser cutting head is moved over the metal plate in the shape of the desired part, thus cutting the part out of the plate.

### what can laser cutter cut through?
Materials we can laser cut
* Plastics: ABS (acrylonitrile butadiene styrene) Acrylic (also known as Plexiglas, Lucite, PMMA) ...
* Thin metals: Stainless steel (up to 0.060") Spring steel (up to 0.060")
* Foam: Depron foam – often used for RC planes. EPM. ...
* Other: Cloths (leather, suede, felt, hemp, cotton) Magnetic sheets.
