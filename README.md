## ABOUT ME
I'm THAFSEERA born and raised in MALAPPURAM. I did my plus 2 from P K M M H S S Edarikode and now i'm pursuing my final year B.tech in electronics and communication at M E S college of engineering Kuttipuram

My strengths are my attitude that i like to take challenges that I CAN do it,my way of thinking that i take both success and failure in a balanced manner..
I dont like to say weakness but i like to say scope for improvement that is i wont leave any ask in completely,i believe in my self and my hard work and i want perfection in every thing.

## WHAT IS FAB LAB
FabLab – digital fabrication laboratories – were set up to inspire people and entrepreneurs to turn their ideas into new products and prototypes by giving them access to a range of advanced digital manufacturing technology.

The idea was conceived by renowned inventor and scientist Professor Neil Gershenfeld at the prestigious Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). His idea was a simple one: to provide the environment, skills, advanced materials and technology to make things cheaply and quickly anywhere in the world, and to make this available on a local basis to entrepreneurs, students, artists, small businesses and in fact, anyone who wants to create something new or bespoke.
## FAB LAB AT MESCE 

FABLAB is a 3D fabrication lab that has been recently set up at our college. It is completely amazing considering the possibilities of turning imagination to reality. It consists of a lot of machines such as the 3D printer, CNC, laser cutter/engraver and others too. I am in the process of diving into the depths of knowledge of how we could turn one’s imagination to reality. Actually this seems no less than magic. Atleast that is how I feel. So, here I am to share my experience at FABLAB, MESCE. I hope that anyone who goes through this will get an idea about the technology used in a 3D fabrication lab. Well … explore and have fun.
# DAY 1
Day 1 [23-08-2017] went well with the introduction by   Mr. Jaseel Muhammed an overview of how the 21 hrs were going to be spent at FABLAB. We went through and just got introduced to all the machines we were going to use and play with. So, today we entered the magical world and were all set to explore more. we created an account in github.also we get an idea about Rhino.we draw some 3d models. .

# DAY 2
DAY 2 [24-08-2017] we did some work in vinyle cutting machine. 

## what is vinyl cutting machine?

A vinyl cutter is a type of computer-controlled machine. Small vinyl cutters look like computer printers. The computer controls the movement of a sharp blade. This blade is used to cut out shapes and letters from sheets of thin self-adhesive plastic (vinyl).
A symbol / label can be produced using a Vinyl Cutter such as a ‘Sticker Machine’ or a ‘Craftrobo’. These machines are controlled by a computer and operate similar to a printer. Essentially they cut out shapes in adhesive vinyl. The vinyl can then be stuck onto almost any surface.
A vinyl cutter (or vinyl plotter) is a computer-controlled plotting device with a blade instead of a pen. A vector based design is created in a software program (usually Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw) and then sent to the cutter where it cuts along the vector paths laid out in the design. The cutter is capable of moving the blade on an X and Y axis over the material, cutting it into any shape imaginable. Since the vinyl material comes in long rolls, projects with significant length like banners or billboards can be easily cut as well. The one major limitation with vinyl cutters is that they can only cut shapes from solid colors of vinyl. A design with multiple colors must have each color cut separately and then layered on top of each other as it is applied to the substrate. Also, since the shapes are cut out of solid colors, photographs and gradients cannot be reproduced with a standalone cutter.
# DAY 3
DAY 3 [25-08-2017]. PCB design. introduction about eagle .we did small led blinging circuit.
### about Eagle 
     EAGLE is a scriptable electronic design automation application with schematic capture, printed circuit board layout, auto-router and computer-aided manufacturing features. EAGLE stands for Easily Applicable Graphical Layout Editor (German: Einfach Anzuwendender Grafischer Layout-Editor) and is developed by CadSoft Computer GmbH. 
     EAGLE contains a schematic editor, for designing circuit diagrams. Parts can be placed on many sheets and connected together through ports.
      The PCB layout editor allows back annotation to the schematic and auto-routing to automatically connect traces based on the connections defined in the schematic.

EAGLE saves Gerber and PostScript layout files and Excellon and Sieb & Meyer drill files. These standard files are accepted by many PCB fabrication companies.

# DAY 4
DAY 4 [26-08-2017]
